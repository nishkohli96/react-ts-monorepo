# react-ts-monorepo

**An ideal template for your project, where I have already set up the key-essentials for your workspaces, so that it saves plenty of time for you.**

### ReactJS package

A choice between `react`(frontend), `react-ts` frontend-ts or `vitejs-react`(react-vite). Feel free to choose your **reactjs** template and remove others. These packages have the following things set up.

-  A well-defined folder structure with a README.md 
-  Eslint & Prettier
-  Alias imports using `react-app-rewired` & `react-app-rewire-alias`
-  imported `@material-ui` & setup routing.
-  Github-Actions to make sure a build is successfully generated on pushing the code to your repository.

### NestJs Backend

- Preconfigured Fastify code with NestJs. Can retain the Fastify code & remove express or vice-versa
